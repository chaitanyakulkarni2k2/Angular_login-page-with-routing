# Angular_login-page-with-routing
This is a simple login and sign up page is designed in angular. But here i have added the routing using routing modules ,Like i have created one component named as blank  component. so when user will click on Sign In button the content of blank.component.html file will be display. So this is possible because of routing.


##### Output #####
![login_page1](https://github.com/chaitanyakulkarni2k2/Angular_login-page-with-routing/assets/108442884/ed975c66-54f6-4366-aea4-8342a6428ffe)
